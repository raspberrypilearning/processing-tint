If you are adding images to your project you can use `tint()` to change the colour of the image.

Passing a colour to `tint()` lets you change the colours of any image you draw after it. The images will look like they have a light of the colour you chose shining on them.

The `no_tint()` function to turn `tint()` off when youâ€™re finished with it.

This example adds a green `tint()` to both images.

  tint(0, 255, 0) # Green tint image(rocket, 50, 50, 100, 100) image(planet, 50, 50, 300, 300)

--- /code ---

This example adds a green `tint()` to the first image then removes it using `no_tint()` before the second image is drawn.

  tint(0, 255, 0) # Green tint image(rocket, 50, 50, 100, 100) no_tint() # Remove tint image(planet, 50, 50, 300, 300) --- /code ---
